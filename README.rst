Eelish
======

Eelish (also spelled ilish by some) is a tropical fish considered a
delicacy in some coastal parts of India.  It also is the name of a
library of lock-free data structures I'm currently working on.

Right now Eelish has a semi-tested mostly lock-free fixed-size vector
(call it a fixed-depth stack, if you will).  Eventually I plan to
include a resizing vector, a probing hashtable and a red-black binary
tree.
